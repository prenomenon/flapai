# FlapAI

This project is for demo purposes and combines a Flappy Bird clone with a basic AI implementation.

The game is a clone of Flappy Bird using Processing (http://p5js.org/).

The AI combines Neural Networks using Synaptic (http://caza.la/synaptic) with a genetic algorithm to evolve populations of AI players using genetic operators.

# FlapAI

This is a learning project and combines a Flappy Bird clone with a basic AI implementation.

The game is a clone of Flappy Bird based on Processing (http://p5js.org/).

The AI combines Neural Networks using TensorFlow.js (https://www.tensorflow.org/js) with evolutionary algorithms to evolve populations of AI players using genetic operators.
